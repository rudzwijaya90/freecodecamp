/* All objects in JavaScript (with a few exceptions) have a prototype. Also, an object’s prototype itself is an object.

      function Bird(name) {
        this.name = name;

      typeof Bird.prototype;
      
Because a prototype is an object, a prototype can have its own prototype! In this case, the prototype of Bird.prototype is Object.prototype */

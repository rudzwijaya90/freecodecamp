/* There's a principle in programming called Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY). The reason repeated code is a problem is because any change requires fixing code in multiple places. This usually means more work for programmers and more room for errors.

Since Animal includes the describe method, you can remove it from Cat and Bear */
